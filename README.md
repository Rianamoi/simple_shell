Invocation
Usage: simple_shell [filename]

To invoke simple_shell, compile all .c files in the repository with the
flag -o simple_shell and run the executable:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic gcc -Wall - *.c -o simple_shell
./simple_shell
simple_shell can be invoked both interactively and non-interactively.

Interactive mode: simple_shell is connected to a terminal and displays the prompt
$ when it is ready to read a command.

Example:

$./simple_shell
$
Non interactive mode If simple_shell is invoked with standard input not connected
to a terminal, it reads and executes received commands in order.

Example:

$ echo "echo 'Holberton'" | ./simple_shell
'Holberton'
$
Cat redirection You can get the same result using the command cat.

Example:

$ cat test_cat | ./simple_shell
'Hello'
"World"
/home/user/simple_shell
$
